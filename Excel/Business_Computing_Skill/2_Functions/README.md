## Exercise 1
Use the file **05 Game Stats**, calculate:
- Average wins:
  ``` =AVERAGE(B3:D3) ```
- Number of plays:
  ``` =COUNT(B3:D12) ```
- Total win:
  ``` =SUM(B3:D12) ```
- Total loss:
  ``` =G2-G3 ```

- Average sales for each of the four service categories using Named Ranges:

  ``` =AVERAGE(Corporate_Contracts) ```

  ``` =AVERAGE(Sky_Diving) ```

  ``` =AVERAGE(Charter_Flights) ```

  ``` =AVERAGE(Flight_School) ```

- Average expenses for each of the four service categories using Named Ranges:

   ``` =AVERAGE(Corporate_Contracts_Exp) ```

  ``` =AVERAGE(Sky_Diving_Expense) ```

  ``` =AVERAGE(Charter_Flights_Exp) ```

  ``` =AVERAGE(Flight_School_Exp) ```
  
- Maximum sales for each of the four service categories using Named Ranges:
  
  ``` =MAX(Corporate_Contracts) ```

  ``` =MAX(Sky_Diving) ```

  ``` =MAX(Charter_Flights) ```

  ``` =MAX(Flight_School) ```

- Maximum expenses for each of the four service categories using Named Ranges:

   ``` =MAX(Corporate_Contracts_Exp) ```

  ``` =MAX(Sky_Diving_Expense) ```

  ``` =MAX(Charter_Flights_Exp) ```

  ``` =MAX(Flight_School_Exp) ```
